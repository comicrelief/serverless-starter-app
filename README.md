# Serverless Starter App [![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/comicrelief/serverless-starter-app.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/comicrelief/serverless-starter-app)
An ES6 starter application that can be used as a base for serverless projects hosted on AWS.

## Local Development

For local development you can simulate lambda and an API endpoint locally using
the following command.

```bash
serverless offline start
```

This repository uses JavaScript import aliases with Webpack. If you are using VS Code, the `jsconfig.json` file should handle the autocompletion for you. If you are using WebStorm, you can refer to [this stackoverflow thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34943631/path-aliases-for-imports-in-webstorm).

## Testing

Tests are located in the `tests` folder an can be invoked by running `yarn test`. These tests will invoke the defined
actions in a wrapper, where the response can then be tested.
